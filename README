This script searchs for rpm in third party repositories for Mageia.
You need first to define the repositories, with the help of the menus in the script.

When you launch the script you will see the follow menu:
------------------
1 - Search package
2 - Add media
3 - List media
4 - Delete media
5 - Search updates
------------------


Also, you can launch the script with an argument
(the name of the rpm that you want to search), and you will not
see the above menu but only the search results.


Note: In the 'Add media' menu, if you press '*', you can see a list
of some known repositories. If you have a repository or you know one and
you would like to be added in the list, feel free to inform me.
